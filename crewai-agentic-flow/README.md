# Event Planning Multi-Agent System

This project implements a multi-agent system using **CrewAI** and **Ollama** models to automate the event planning process. It defines three agents:

1. **Event Planning Agent**: Responsible for creating event plans, schedules, and itineraries.
2. **Vendor Coordination Agent**: Manages communication and coordination with vendors.
3. **Budget Management Agent**: Ensures the event stays within budget while maintaining quality.

## Installation

To set up the project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install crewai==0.105.0 crewai_tools ollama
```
